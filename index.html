      <p>
        Only Up map is like parkour but you go only up it's actully funny map
        but you need much time to finish this map but i finished it only 2 times
      </p>

      <img
        src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_LB8oFsLUw4/maxresdefault.jpg"
        alt="Only Up"
        width="700"
      />
      <p>And the Second is...</p>
      <p>Parkour</p>
      <p>
        Parkour is like the same like only up but you go only forward and i like
        this map because i like to jump wallrun and somethinks like this
      </p>
      <p>Here onder is one more picture</p>
      <img
        src="https://tiermaker.com/images/template_images/2022/15757384/gorilla-tag-map-tier-list-15757384/screenshot-2023-04-30-105648.png"
        alt="Parkour"
        width="600"
      />
      <p>And The First place is...</p>
      <p>Forest</p>
      <img
